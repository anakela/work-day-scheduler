## Overview

### The Challenge

> Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

> The starter code uses the Moment.js (Links to an external site.) library to work with date and time, but feel free to use a different JavaScript solution to handle this functionality since [Moment.js](https://courses.bootcampspot.com/courses/1693/assignments/26729?module_item_id=537732#:~:text=Create%20a%20simple,project%20status%20page.) is considered a "legacy" project. Learn more about some alternative solutions in the [Moment.js project status page](https://courses.bootcampspot.com/courses/1693/assignments/26729?module_item_id=537732#:~:text=Create%20a%20simple,project%20status%20page.).

> #### IMPORTANT
> Make sure to clone the starter code repository and make your own repository with the starter code. Do not fork the starter code repository!

> Before you start, clone the [starter code](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/super-disco).

### User Story

```
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```

### Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```
