## Overview

### The Challenge

> As you proceed in your journey to becoming a full-stack web developer, it’s likely that you’ll be asked to complete a coding assessment, perhaps as part of an interview process. A typical coding assessment is a combination of multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges.

> To help you become familiar with these tests and give you a chance to apply the skills from this module, this week’s Challenge invites you to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface. This week’s coursework will teach you all the skills you need to succeed in this assignment.

> #### NOTE  
> Coding assessments are an important part of the interview process for developers. In fact, employers often use them to filter out job candidates with a cut-off score. To help you prepare, we’ve developed a set of technical interview questions that you can answer throughout the course. The difficulty level of these questions will increase as you become a more proficient developer. If you take advantage of these opportunities to practice, you should be well-prepared to shine during the technical interview process toward the end of this course!

### User Story

> AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

### Acceptance Criteria

> GIVEN I am taking a code quiz  
> WHEN I click the start button  
> THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question  
> WHEN I answer a question  
> THEN I am presented with another question  
> WHEN I answer a question incorrectly  
> THEN time is subtracted from the clock  
> WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0  
> THEN the game is over  
> WHEN the game is over  
> THEN I can save my initials and score  

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**
